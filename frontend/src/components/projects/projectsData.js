It has already been handed to the client but I am still voluntarily working to make it better. The main feature applied was event booking with the help of the calendar. The organization organizes different events on different dates, and the events were supposed to have different individual links and those links to be inserted on the calendar on the specific day the event is on. The languages used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sass was used for the CSS compilation.",
